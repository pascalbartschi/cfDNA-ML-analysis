# Analysis of cf DNA data with Machine Learning tools

### Introduction

Liquid biopsy is an upcoming diagnostic and monitoring tool in cancer care. Whole genome cell-free DNA sequencing allows for the investigation of different features that inform about the presence, type and size of the tumor. Machine learning is increasingly used in the medical domain and can be employed to uncover insightful patterns in the data.

### About
This repository contains the code for the analysis of cfDNA-data taken from [Lo et al. (2021)<sup></sup>](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaw3616) and findings of this project are summarised in [this poster](https://github.com/pascalbartschi/cfDNA-ML-analysis/blob/main/poster.pdf).
